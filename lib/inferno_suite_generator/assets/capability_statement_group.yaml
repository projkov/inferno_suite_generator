title: 1.1 Capability Statement
short_description: >-
  Retrieve information about supported server functionality using the FHIR
  capabilties interaction.
description: >-
  # Background

  The Capability Statement Sequence tests a FHIR server's ability to formally
  describe features supported by the API by using the [Capability
  Statement](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/capabilitystatement.html) resource. The
  features described in the Capability Statement must be consistent with the
  required capabilities of a AU Core **Responder**. The Capability Statement
  resource allows clients to determine which resources are supported by a FHIR
  Server. Not all servers are expected to implement all possible queries and
  data elements described in the AU Core API. The **AU Core Responder Capability Statement** requires that
      the Patient resource and **at least** one additional resource profile from the AU Core profiles.

  # Testing Methodology

  This test sequence accesses the server endpoint at `/metadata` using a `GET`
  request. It parses the Capability Statement and verifies that: * The endpoint
  is secured by an appropriate cryptographic protocol * The resource matches the
  expected FHIR version defined by the tests * The resource is a valid FHIR
  resource * The server claims support for JSON encoding of resources * The
  server claims support for the Patient resource and one other resource It
  collects the following information that is saved in the testing session for
  use by later tests: * List of resources supported * List of queries parameters
  supported

    title: 1.1.2 FHIR Server supports the conformance interaction
    description: >-
      The conformance 'whole system' interaction provides a method to get the
      CapabilityStatement for the FHIR server. This test checks that the server
      responds to a `GET` request at the following endpoint: ``` GET
      [base]/metadata ``` This test checks the following SHALL requirement: >
      Applications SHALL return a resource that describes the functionality of
      the server end-point.
      [http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/http.html#capabilities)
      It does this by checking that the server responds with an HTTP OK 200
      status code and that the body of the response contains a valid
      [CapabilityStatement
      resource](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/capabilitystatement.html). This test does
      not inspect the content of the CapabilityStatement to see if it contains
      the required information. It only checks to see if the RESTful interaction
      is supported and returns a valid CapabilityStatement resource.

    title: 1.1.4 FHIR server capability states JSON support
    description: >-
      FHIR provides multiple [representation
      formats](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/formats.html) for resources, including
      JSON and XML. AU Core profiles require servers to use the [JSON
      representation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/json.html): [```The AU Core
      Server **SHALL** Support json source formats for all AU Core Responder
      interactions.```](http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/0.3.0-ballot/CapabilityStatement-au-core-server.html#title)
      The FHIR conformance interaction require servers to describe which formats
      are available for clients to use. The server must explicitly state that
      JSON is supported. This is located in the format element of the
      CapabilityStatement Resource. This test checks that one of the following
      values are located in the format field. * json * application/json *
      application/fhir+json

      Types
    description: >-
      The AU Core Implementation Guide states: ``` The AU Core Server SHALL: 1.
      Support the AU Core Patient resource. 2. Support at least one additional
      AU Core resources. ```
